In this project, I have solved a card game using BFS (Breadth-First Search), IDS (Iterative Deepening depth-first Search), and A* algorithms.
The card game consists of different columns of cards. Each card has a number from 1 to n (you can set n yourself) and has a color associated with it. 
The goal of the game is to get to a state in which every column has contains cards of the same color and the numbers of cards are sorted in s descending order.
The only possible move is to move the last card from and put it as the final card of another column.
